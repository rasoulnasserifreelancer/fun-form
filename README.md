🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, transitions)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, mouse tracking)


🧪 How It Works
- Eye Movement: Uses mousemove to calculate pointer position and rotate pupils.
- Blink & Smile: On mouseenter event, triggers CSS transitions to close eyes and reveal smile.
- Blink & Smile: On mouseleave event, triggers CSS transitions to open eyes and hide smile.
- Layout Stability: Smile is hidden via opacity and transform, not removed from DOM—preserving layout integrity.
